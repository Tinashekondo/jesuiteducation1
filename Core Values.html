				<h2>The Core Values of Jesuit Education</h2>
				

<P>Core values form one's character and personality. It is said if wealth is lost, something is lost but you can rebuild it. But if one's character is lost, everything is lost. Hence understanding more about core values helps you appreciate the power of Jesuit education. The following are some important core values.</P>

                <P>1.	'Finding God in All Things'</br>
This value stresses that we need to seek God in every one, in every place and in everything. We are aware that the world and human beings are not perfect. It has its own brokenness, contradictions and failures. But we need not run away from this reality or reject it. Through socio-political, religious-cultural analysis, we need to discover what promotes better human life for all. Hence the process of discernment calls us to recognize, and then choose the good and reject evil. We cannot do this without a sense of God. Hence Jesuit education seeks to help students find God in all things and accordingly make right choices.  </P>

<P>2.	'Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam' (AMDG)</br>
In English it means 'to the greater glory of God'. For St. Ignatius, regardless of who we are, we should focus on seeking and serving 'the greater glory of God'. We should not be satisfied with the status quo. We must not only do good things, but we should do them for the right reasons. Hence 'for the greater glory of God' denotes that in every task we should have a worthy end in mind. This requires courage to become fearless persons, willing to leave our comfort zone, and to be challenged and stretched by new possibilities.</P>

<P>3.	'Cura Personalis' or 'Care for the Whole Person'.</br> 
Jesuit Education aims at the development of the whole person—intellectually, spiritually, physically, emotionally and socially. It is attuned to the unique talents of each student, and is attentive to the needs of the whole person. Hence Jesuit schools seek to nurture and promote the best in everyone, and help each one to reach his/her greatest human potential. This core value also implies a commitment to inclusivity, a caring for students of all backgrounds especially for students at risk. </P>

<P>4.	'Magis' - 'More'</br>
Ignatius placed great emphasis on seeking 'greater good' in every choice we make. Hence the core value, 'Magis' instils in students the desire to strive for something that is better, greater, more challenging, and more difficult. This is reflected in the individual’s desire for constant improvement, and in the attitude of being a life-long learner. </P>

<P>5.	Commitment to Excellence</br>
In Jesuit schools commitment to excellence means a commitment to human excellence. This implies the pursuit of academic excellence along with growth in attitudes, values and skills. Academic excellence pushes students to achieve beyond their current level of performance. It also includes a love for learning, discovery, and integration across a wide range of disciplines and interests. </P>

<P>6.	Promoting Justice</br>
Jesuit education affirms educating students for justice. It strives to foster social awareness at the global and local level through its outreach and curricular activities. This creates a sense of solidarity with and care for all who struggle for justice. Students display respect for all individuals and their basic right to fair and equal treatment. They show a deep concern for the marginalized citizens of our society. This involves the commitment to develop one's and others' gifts and talents to make a positive difference in the world. </P>

<P>7.	Care for the Environment</br>
Jesuit education creates awareness of our planet and promotes affirmative action for the care and protection of Mother Earth. Our survival depends on the environment and it is everyone's responsibility to take care of it. The pollution in various areas (air, water, sound, etc.) needs everyone's cooperation in order to save the environment from further destruction. Jesuit education supports eco-clubs and eco-friendly behaviours that express care for the environment and the desire to make Mother Earth a better place to live in.  </P>
<P>8.	Appreciation for Cultural Differences
Culture is a group or community's shared common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It influences their views, their values, their hopes, their loyalties, and their worries and fears. Appreciating cultures helps cultural groups to come together and be more effective in achieving common goals. An appreciation of cultural diversity goes hand-in-hand with a just and equitable society. 

<P>9.	Respect for Other Faiths</br>
Today pluralism of faiths is a reality in many countries.  Teaching respect for other faiths and appreciating religious diversity is critical in maintaining peace and security in the world. Jesuit education fosters inclusivity by having students of diverse faiths, and encourages them to explore common values and building bridges among diverse faiths through varied enrichment programmes. </P>

<P>10.	Service of Others</br>
Jesuit education guides students to a greater love and service of others, especially the poor, the oppressed and those in need. It seeks to develop talents, skills and other competencies in the individual and place them at the service of others. Hence students' formation is not merely geared to make a high living but to make their lives meaningful in the service of others. </P>

<P>On July 31, 1973, at the 10th International Congress of Jesuit Alumni of Europe in Valencia, Spain, Fr. Pedro Arrupe, the 28th Superior General of the Society of Jesus, articulated the famous expression ‘Men for Others’. He stated that the prime objective of Jesuit education is to form men for others, men who will not live for themselves but for God. This love for God essentially includes love of neighbour. Moreover, love of God without doing justice is a farce. </P>

<P>"We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” – Winston Churchill.</P>

<P>The core values of Jesuit education facilitate in developing students of:</P>

<P>1.	Competence:</br> 
It denotes the ability to do a job properly. It indicates a combination of knowledge, attitude, skills and behaviour used to improve performance. In other words the person, who is qualified to perform a specific role, can do the job in thoroughness in a wide variety of situations. The person applies interdisciplinary approaches to problems, thinks critically and creatively, and expresses himself/herself proficiently in both oral and written communication. He/she regularly updates, seeks constructive criticism and takes others' help and support for his/her continual growth. </P>

<P>2.	Conscience:</br>
In a Jesuit school, students are encouraged and trained to lead a life in harmony with ethical principles such as sharing, forgiveness, integrity, truthfulness and respect for life in our environment. A person of conscience discerns what is right, good and true and has the courage to do it. He/she practices the habit of reflection and enjoys communion with God. His/her conscience encourages valuing inter-religious collaboration and respect for the faith of diverse religious communities. His/her decisions and actions are in consonance with principles of justice and a better life for all.</P>

<P>3.	Compassion:</br>
It denotes solidarity and empathy to those in greatest need. A person of compassion manifests a preferential love for the poor and disadvantaged of the society. He/she serves others and finds fulfilment in actions that affirm the dignity of every person as a son and daughter of God. He/she actively engages himself/herself in the life of the local and global community.</P>

<P>4.	Commitment:</br>
It denotes one's willingness and determination to give one's time, talents and expertise for a task or a cause that brings a positive change in oneself and in society. This requires openness to one's growth, and an understanding of the roots of injustice in our social institutions. He/she advocates social changes that assist victims of injustice in regaining their rights and human dignity. He/she networks with others to influence public policy that eradicates inequalities and promotes a just society.</P>
